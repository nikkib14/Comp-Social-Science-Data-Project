README

Welcome to my Github, this repository contains an example of an R coding assignment
I have completed in one class as part of my schooling.

This assignment was focused on using R in order to perform some type of Data Analysis and
Visualization, and then to create and deploy an R Shiny app with a usable UI for testing.
